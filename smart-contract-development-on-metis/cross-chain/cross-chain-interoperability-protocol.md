# Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol

The **Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)** is a powerful tool that allows developers to build cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps) that communicate seamlessly between different blockchain networks. With CCIP on Metis, you can enable smart contracts on one chain (e.g., Ethereum) to trigger actions on Metis and vice versa. This opens up new possibilities for cross-chain applications, asset transfers, and messaging between Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.\
\
The CCIP provides a secure, scalable way to handle complex cross-chain interactions, ensuring consistency and security in a multi-chain environment.

## **Examples of Cross-Chain Projects using CCIP**

To help you get started with CCIP on Metis, we’ve provided the following examples and open-source code contributions from the community. These examples show real-world use cases of how CCIP can be implemented.

### **1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game with CCIP**

This example demonstrates how you can use CCIP to build a cross-chain Tic-Tac-Toe game that operates across different blockchain networks. Players on different chains can participate in the game, with contract calls interacting across chains seamlessly.

[**Tic-Tac-Toe CCIP Example**](https://github.com/metis-edu/Community-contributions/tree/main/CCIP/Tic-Tac-Toe-CCIP)

This repository contains:

* Solidity contracts for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
* Cross-chain messaging setup using CCIP.
* Detailed README on how to deploy and test the project.

### **2. Simple Transfer with CCIP**

This repository showcases how to set up a basic token transfer system using CCIP to move assets between chains. It’s a simple, foundational use case that can be extended to more complex asset management solutions or cross-chain DeFi applications.
