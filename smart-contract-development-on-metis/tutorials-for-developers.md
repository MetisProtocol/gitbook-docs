# Tutorials for Developers

To help you refine your skills, this section offers a set of tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced topics. The tutorials will provide hands-on experience with Metis smart contract deployment, gas optimization, and cross-chain operations.

* Deploying Your First Contract
* Bridging ETH Between Ethereum and Metis
* Optimizing Gas Fees on Metis
* Bridging Custom Tokens

#### **1. Deploying Your First Contract**

Learn how to deploy your very first smart contract on the **Metis Andromeda** network. This step-by-step guide will walk you through writing a simple Solidity contract, compiling it, and deploying it to the Metis testnet using tools like **Remix** or **Hardhat**.

\[**Start the Tutorial**]

#### **2. Bridging ETH Between Ethereum and Metis**

This tutorial will teach you how to bridge **ETH** from Ethereum (Layer 1) to **Metis** using the **Metis Bridge**. You’ll learn how to set up the bridge, transfer tokens, and interact with assets on both chains.
