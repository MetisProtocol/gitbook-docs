# Metis Audits

Ensuring the security and safety of the Metis Layer 2 network is a top priority. To maintain the highest standards of security, Metis undergoes regular security audits conducted by industry-leading blockchain security firms. These audits meticulously review our smart contracts, bridges, and protocol to identify any vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of our ecosystem.

Security audits are essential to maintaining the trust of users and developers, ensuring that our code is free from vulnerabilities and secure against potential threats.
