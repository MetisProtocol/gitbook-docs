# How to become a sequencer \[Testnet]

To become a Sequencer during the first year of the trial operation phase, you must join the whitelist. To apply, please submit a proposal to become a sequencer on the [Metis Governance forum](https://ceg.vote/c/infrastructure-sequencer/). A team member will contact you.

We hope you can contribute to the Metis ecosystem by:

* Having experience in operating blockchain nodes.
* Possessing servers and network environments that meet the requirements (see below).
* Holding and locking a certain amount of METIS. The current lock-up threshold is 20,000 METIS, with a maximum of 100,000 METIS allowed for lock-up.

We will adjust the threshold and cap through governance based on how the pool operates. You can acquire METIS through the open market or by participating in the Sequencer pool's mining activity by locking up METIS.

We will gradually increase the number of Sequencers and phase out the whitelist mechanism, allowing more flexible and free joining of the Metis Sequencer Pool through governance.

### Metis Token and Wallet

METIS is the utility token of the Metis Andromeda network, the same way that Ether is to Ethereum. To use the Metis network, you need METIS tokens to pay for gas fees. Locking Metis benefits the whole network, increasing its security while also reducing the circulating supply of tokens.
