# How to become a sequencer

To become a Sequencer during the first year of the trial operation phase, you must join the [whitelist](../whitelist.md) (Please check out whitelist page for more information). To apply, please submit a proposal to become a sequencer on the [Metis Governance forum](https://ceg.vote/c/infrastructure-sequencer/). A team member will contact you.

Anyone can become a sequencer by meeting the technical and staking requirements. The process includes:

1. Locking a minimum amount of METIS tokens.
2. Setting up and running a sequencer node with the required technical specifications.
3. Complying with governance rules and participating in community voting.
