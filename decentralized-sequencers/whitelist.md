# Whitelist

**Why is the Whitelist Required?**

The whitelist mechanism helps maintain the stability and security of the network by allowing only approved entities to become Sequencers. Over time, the whitelist will be phased out to enable open and flexible participation governed by community governance.

***

#### **Applying for Whitelist**

To participate in the initial phases of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Pool, prospective Sequencers need to apply for the **Whitelist**. This ensures that only qualified and committed participants join the network during its early operations.
