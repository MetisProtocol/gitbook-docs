# Smart contract (natspec)

Smart Contracts play a critical role in the Metis Layer 2 ecosystem, enabling secure and decentralized management of Sequencer operations and network activities. This section provides detailed **natSpec (Ethereum Natural Specification Format)** documentation for both Mainnet and Testnet contracts. By adhering to natSpec standards, we ensure clarity and transparency for developers and auditors alike.

The **Smart Contract (natSpec)** section is split into two key guides:

1. [**Mainnet Smart Contract**](mainnet-smart-contract-natspec.md) **(natSpec):**\
   Detailed documentation for contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet, covering production-grade operations and locking mechanisms for METIS tokens.
2. [**Testnet Smart Contract**](testnet-smart-contract-natspec.md) **(natSpec):**\
   Documentation for contracts deployed on Sepolia Testnet, offering a sandbox environment for testing and experimentation.
