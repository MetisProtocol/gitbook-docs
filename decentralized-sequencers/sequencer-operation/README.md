# Sequencer operation

The **Metis Sequencer Operation** page provides comprehensive resources for understanding and managing the operations of Sequencers on both the **Mainnet** and **Testnet** environments. This documentation is designed to guide developers, operators, and participants in efficiently running and maintaining Sequencer nodes while ensuring a seamless experience in supporting the decentralized Metis Layer 2 network.

***

To streamline your journey, we have divided the guides into two sections:

* [**Mainnet Sequencer Operation Guide**](mainnet-sequencer-operation-guide.md): A detailed walkthrough for setting up and maintaining Sequencer nodes on the Metis Mainnet. This guide includes specific steps for locking METIS tokens, node synchronization, and managing mining rewards.
* [**Testnet Sequencer Operation Guide**](testnet-sequencer-operation-guide.md): A preparatory guide for deploying Sequencers in the Testnet environment. This guide helps you familiarize yourself with the Sequencer workflow, enabling you to test operations and configurations in a sandboxed environment before transitioning to the Mainnet.

**What is a Sequencer?**

Sequencers are integral components of the Metis Layer 2 network, responsible for:

* **Transaction validation**: Ensuring that user transactions are received, validated, and packaged into blocks.
* **Block production**: Sequentially producing blocks and submitting them to the Layer 1 Ethereum network.
* **Network security**: Contributing to the decentralization and security of the Metis blockchain by participating in multi-party computation (MPC) and staking METIS tokens.

By participating as a Sequencer, you directly support the reliability, scalability, and decentralization of the Metis network.

**Where to Start?**

1. **For new operators**:
   * Begin with the **Testnet Sequencer Operation Guide** to understand the process and test your setup in a controlled environment.
2. **For experienced operators**:
   * Proceed to the **Mainnet Sequencer Operation Guide** for detailed instructions on participating in the live Metis network.
