#### What is a Decentralized Network?

In a decentralized network, control is distributed across multiple participants rather than being concentrated in a central authority. This ensures:

* **Resilience**: Prevents single points of failure.
* **Security**: Guards against malicious attacks by spreading control across the network.
* **Transparency**: Enables open and verifiable operations.
* **Censorship Resistance**: Protects against undue influence or restrictions by centralized entities.

Metis is pioneering decentralized infrastructure by integrating advanced governance and **Decentralized Sequencers**, enabling a robust and equitable environment for blockchain applications.
