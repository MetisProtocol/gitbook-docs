# Faucet

## Testnet Faucets

Faucets are essential tools for developers that allow you to receive free Metis on Metis test networks like Sepolia. These tokens enable you to send transactions, test smart contracts, and build decentralized applications in a risk-free environment.

Below, you'll find a list of active faucets you can use to acquire test tokens for Metis networks. Since faucets may vary in how they authenticate users, you might need to try a few to find the best one for your needs. Faucets may also run out of tokens from time to time, so if one is not working, try another from the list.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Testnet tokens are only meant for testing purposes and hold no real value. Make sure to request only what you need to help keep the faucet available for others.
