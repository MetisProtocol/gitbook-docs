# Oracles

**Oracles** bridge the gap between blockchain systems and the external world, enabling smart contracts to interact with off-chain data sources. By connecting blockchains to external systems, oracles provide the crucial capability for smart contracts to execute based on real-world inputs, such as market prices, weather data, or random number generation.

Metis is integrated with leading Oracle providers to ensure developers have reliable and secure access to external data. Below is an overview of the Oracle providers supported within the Metis ecosystem:

***

#### **Why Oracles Are Important**

* **Data Accessibility**: Fetch and use off-chain data for your on-chain applications (e.g., asset prices, weather conditions, random numbers).
* **Decentralization**: Ensures that data sources and their delivery are decentralized to avoid single points of failure.
* **Automation**: Enable dynamic execution of smart contracts based on real-time data feeds.
